## Summary
When reflecting on a career, and finding that it is not one that you are passionate about, it's easy to compare your situation with people who *are* passionate about what they do. Indeed these people are often held up as "ideals" for what it means to have a meaningful life.
But in reality there are two kinds of people - those who have found something that they feel called to do in their lives, and those who are interested in a variety of things but no one single calling.
However, it is not the aim to find this "one thing" - but instead a career that gives a sense of significance. That is work that intrinsically interests and motivates you.

There are three steps to finding such a career.
### Pay attention to the things that interest you
Think about what you are drawn to, what you like to talk about, and what you want to learn more about.
### Engage with your interests
Take time to pursue these interests. Emphasis on the plural - so that you can have a better method of comparing them with each other in terms of the satisfaction you derive from them.

### Figure out what a career in this field could look like
Now that you've taken time to figure out what it is that would motivate you, start exploring what sort of jobs align with this, how you can break into these roles, and start thinking about networking in this area.
