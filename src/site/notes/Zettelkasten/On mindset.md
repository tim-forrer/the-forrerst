As part of my photography course, I need to make a series of images that are all linked by some theme.
Currently, I'm thinking that I'd quite like to take a series of images that are calm in some way. Whilst the bright neon-light cyberpunk images are definitely cool to look at in small doses, like white chocolate, too much makes me a little uncomfortable. I'd like to make some images that I'm happy to take my time to look at. So on Saturday I set off for Tamagawa River[^1] in search of some nice, calming photos.

It was a disaster.

From the moment I stepped off the train everything felt like pure chaos. First I couldn't figure out how to actually exit the station. Then when I got near the river I spotted a photo that I wanted to take - but I couldn't take it because it was a narrow road with no pavement and constant traffic.

There's a nice path that goes along side the river but unfortunately it doubles as a cycle path that seems pretty popular, so again it was impractical to stand still to take a photo. And there's also a bridge, but it seemed to be the only one in sight so naturally it too was heavily congested with traffic. This just set a tone of constant unease for me, and very much did not put me in the right frame of mind to take photos.

To be completely honest, I was a bit upset about the whole adventure, and came away thinking that there weren't any photos there at all.

But I came across [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/@markhampshirephotography) last night[^2], which helped my reframe my entire experience, and indeed made me question why I even thought it necessary to go to Tamagawa river in the first place. So this weekend I'm going to try again. I haven't decided where, maybe Tamagawa again, maybe somewhere else. Doesn't matter.

[^1]: I'm not sure if I should just call it Tama river, since gawa means river, but that's what people seem to call it in English.
[^2]: It's sad to say, but sometimes the algorithms really do show you good stuff. This channel (somehow) has less than 1k subscribers, but it's exactly up my street and if I do start a channel is the sort of style I'd want to follow.
