>[!quote] Look to others for inspiration, not comparison.

This is a quote from a recent [Viktor Axelsen video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUjLTT2RYFU), which is aimed at badminton but I felt it resonate quite strongly with me for reasons outside of badminton.

I've found recently that I've gotten to be quite, displeased?, unhappy?, ashamed?, of the photos I've been taking. I feel like they often lack any kind of feeling in them.
This has been compounded by the fact that someone I know who recently (relative to me anyway) got into photography and is taking photos of consistently higher quality than my own.

But rather than using this a motivation for improvement, I find myself tending towards wanting to cower away. I think to myself, maybe I'll just never be any good at photography.

Of course this is a falsehood, but perhaps there's a part of me that would be comforted by this fact - because then I'll never have to challenge myself to get any better. If I deceive myself then it's easy to say there's no point in striving to be better, so I don't need to try.

This is exactly the kind of self-talk that I think has stunted many of the things I've pursued in the past (there have been a lot...), but I think recognising it is the first step to moving past it. It has to be, right?

It takes effort to be good at anything. That's all it takes. I need to rid myself of the opinion that there are limits on my own ability that do not exist for others. I need to revel in my inadequacy - because this gives me directions to improve. It's far better to know that you are lacking because once you lose this awareness, how do you know where to improve?

I think also, I need to derive pleasure from the effort of getting better - because that's all there is in photography. There is no measurable point at which you can say "Ok I've reached the level I set out for myself" - you have to be able to derive pleasure from the process of getting better.

This is a tactic that I've employed in the gym recently, but I think in some ways it's easier to derive tangible pleasure from physical effort because the effort is tangible. I suppose there's also greater certainty in the reward from the effort - if countless people say that going to the gym will make you stronger, it's pretty easy to take that as a fact.

Taking photos though, in many ways it's effort*less* - though perhaps it shouldn't be. There should be thought put into every photograph, without thinking how can you hope to improve? It needs to become difficult to press the shutter - but not impossible, like how I pick a weight that's difficult to lift but not beyond my current strength. And there needs to be a plan - that changes over time.

Perhaps now I say, ok I can take photos more freely, because I don't yet have a strong enough photographic eye to see what I think makes for a good photograph. But over time, I make it harder for myself to take a photo unless I'm certain I've got it the way I want it. It's just like going to the gym - start with the easy weights, progress to the hard ones.

Or maybe I've got it wrong, and I should restrict my photos at the start - build "good form" - so that in future it becomes second-nature to take shots that I like.

But I suppose ultimately there is no "wrong" plan - apart from not taking any photographs at all.

The motto that I've got written on my README.md for my notes is "Do not let 'good' be the enemy of 'perfect'."

I should remember that more often.
