A colour model is a system for describing a colour with numbers.
Each number corresponds to a [[Zettelkasten/Colour Models - Channels\|channel]] of the colour model.

# Examples
## RGB
In the RGB model, a colour is described by three numbers, it's red value, it's green value, and it's blue value.

It's typically used to describe colours in images displayed digitally on screens.

## CYMK
In the CYMK model, a colour is described by four numbers, values for cyan, yellow, magenta, and key (black).

It's typically used to describe colours in an image that is to be printed.
