Despite my physics background, this is not going to be about the actual *physical* concept of inertia[^1] - rather it's going to be about *mental* inertia.

I think it's been quite a popular concept amongst many people in the productivity world, but I realised today that it really is quite an apt one.

In our photography class today, we were taken out by our lecturer for a photowalk/lecture on 本郷 (Hongo) campus. For the first half of the class, I did not take a single picture. Not because there was nothing interesting - but because I never felt there was anything interesting enough. But given that all my other classmates were taking a whole bunch of pictures I felt some kind of a pressure to take a photo of *something*.

Eventually I took one - and it was entirely unremarkable and I've subsequently deleted it. But it really did unlock something in my mindset. All of a sudden I was much more willing to try and take a photo. It didn't have to be National Geographic award-winning - I was more than happy to take a photo of anything.

I suppose the real lesson from today (although there were many useful things to think about) was that if I ever feel like a given day won't produce any photos, I just need to take one to get the ball rolling. After all - as the lecturer pointed out on multiple occasions - in the age of digital, taking a picture costs nothing.
