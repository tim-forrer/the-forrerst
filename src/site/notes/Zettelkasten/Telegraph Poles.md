There's a contrast in how they often seem like they are alone, but in reality are connected to so many other poles, and indeed connect people.

Maybe an image of someone on the phone under a telegraph pole would be a way to highlight this. Or a crowd of people milling underneath one (a long exposure could be nice way to contrast it's permanence).

Further thought required here.
