# How it's built
The content on this website all comes from notes in my Obsidian vault. It's published through the incredible [Obsidian Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) plugin. There's a detailed guide that takes you through all the necessary steps to build your own if you like.

The styling is mostly managed by the [Minimal](https://minimal.guide/home) theme for Obsidian - apart from images (see below).

## Images
For photos, I altered the 11ty [build pipeline](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/configure-build-pipeline/), and took advantage of [slots](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/configure-build-pipeline/) to add the [masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/) and [gLightbox](https://biati-digital.github.io/glightbox/) javascript libraries to this website.
This took a lot of effort on my behalf - about 75% of which could have been avoided if I'd had just read the instructions on the Obsidian Digital Garden website linked at the start of this paragraph - but I think overall it was worth it.

I've written down the process in a little more detail in this [[Zettelkasten/How to add masonry and gLightbox to Obsidian Digital Garden\|note]] if you want to learn more - and my repository is available [here](https://github.com/tim-forrer/the-forrerst) which may also help you out.

# Ratings
When giving ratings, I'll be giving a rating from 0 - 5, with 5 being the best. I will generally avoid giving ratings to content that I decide not to finish. I think this is fairest because these reviews are snapshot evaluations of an entire piece of work, but I'll try to comment why I gave up on something.
