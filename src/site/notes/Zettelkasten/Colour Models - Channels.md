A channel stores the information for one of the components of a colour model.

We can talk about the channel for an individual pixel, the value it takes in that channel, or for an entire image, which is a complete array of channel values for every pixel in the image.
# Examples

## RGB
The RGB colour model has three channels: red, green, and blue. The red channel describes how much red is in the colour. Similarly for the green and blue channels.

## CYMK
The CYMK colour model has four channels: cyan, yellow, magenta, and key (black).
