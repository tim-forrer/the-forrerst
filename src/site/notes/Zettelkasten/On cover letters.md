Well here we are.

I've spent the past eight years of my life trying to avoid it but I'm finally looking for a job. And in doing so, I've got to write a cover letter. Joy.

I think I'm not opposed to the fundamental idea of a cover letter - makes sense to try and give some further insight into who you are, or what motivates you. In some respects I think it's advantageous for me as well, especially since I'm pivoting so hard away from physics/science/research in general.

What I'm not such a fan of though, is not knowing whether it's going to make the blindest bit of difference, because the (un)luck HR person who has to read my application may never even touch the cover letter.

On this application I'm working on currently, the cover letter is optional... What sort of cruel game is that? Of course I'm going to write one, but now I've got a further layer of psychological warfare to contend with - do they say that because they just won't read it, or is it some secret test to see whether you *really* want this job or not.[^1]

Then there's the whole issue of whether it's going to get screened by some bespoke flavour of ChatGPT that's been farmed out with a special capability to toss out all but the most keywordy of applications.[^2] In that case I should strategise and fill the cover letter with keywords, but if not then would it not be better to spend time justifying the lack of relevant (read: non-keyword) experience? Maybe the best compromise is to say that I don't have keyword X and here's why it doesn't matter. That way I'll hit both points, even if it is too direct.

Anyways, back to (looking for) work.

[^1]: I guess the reasonable thing to say is that they'll read it if you write one and it might help set out your stall, but job applications are stressful and everyone needs to vent now and then.
[^2]: I like to imagine that these AI recruiters are really just janky python scripts that accept or reject based on whether the keyword ratio exceeds a certain threshold. I'm pretty sure it would give the same results anyway, but without the patronising tone and at a fraction of the cost.
