# Notation
Throughout these notes there will be some common notation used.

$X$ - random variable which is the population.
$\{ X_{i} \}_{i=1}^{n}$ - sequence of $n$ mutually independent random variables, which each has the same distribution as $X$ (called i.i.d.).
$(X_{1}, \dots, X_{n})$ sample of size $n$, *before* they are observed.
$(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})$ the sample *after* observation.
