# Notes
This style of image is very much of the same vein of photography that I best enjoy viewing, and want to take inspiration from.

## Composition
There are three things that have the greatest visual weight for me in this image.

The first is the red つけめん sign on the left. This might be because つけめん is one of my favourite foods, but it's also given prominence by the richness of the red background against which the text is set against. Perhaps also the alternation of white → red → white is quite striking in its contrast that might be something to be learnt from. Another thing that leads the eye there is the general diagonal of the building rooftops from the top right towards the sign. That the sky is completely clear also helps to enforce that we should follow this diagonal down, rather than up and out of frame.

The next are the red stairs to the far right, which highlight the how the time of day of this image has particularly added to the overall mood of the photo. Their zigzagging nature is particularly serve to break up the otherwise mostly vertical and horizontal lines that are found throughout the rest of the image.

The third is the person staring at the real estate advertisements, who's darker coloured clothes pick them out against the white paper stuck to the windows. At first glance it's not entirely obvious what they are doing, but even though they are small in the frame, it is clear they are looking at something - the slight bend in posture serves as a further hint that this something is worth our curiosity.

Having looked for a bit longer, I find an image of a marble rolling down a slope comes to mind. But rather than feeling out of control, it feels like there is a gentleness to it, which is created by the rooftops of the buildings to the left forming a counter-diagonal that is continued by the shadow they cast. It's probably easier to just use a visual aid.

In this way, there's a sense of gentle intention given to the image, which creates a sense of relief, rather than worry that the image is running away with it's own momentum.

## Colour
The image is filled with warmth, not just from the original colours that are present but also through the slight almost pink cast that is blanketing the image.
Combined with the desaturated sky this makes for really allows me to lose myself in the image, rather than become nauseated by any subjects that pop out too much.

The lack of strong contrast between shadows and highlights also contributes to the overall softness of the image.

## Would what I have done differently?
I think the only thing part of the image that doesn't add (but I wouldn't say it detracts either) are the people waiting for the bus stop, which might have helped solidify the person reading the housing signs as a stronger point of interest.

By looking up the number of the real-estate agent, I was able to find out that this image was taken outside of Nishi-Kawaguchi station in Saitama.
Looking at the street-view I think helps you to appreciate how skilled the overall composition of the image was.
