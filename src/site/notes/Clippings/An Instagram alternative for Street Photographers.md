>[!info]- Description
>Shane and Josh discuss why they started Framelines community, take a look at some of the community Street Assignment Submissions and share some footage from a recent photowalk.

# Notes

Discuss their platform for street photographers to meet, which is supposed to be viewed as a gentle community of like-minded people who want to work to improve their photography (it's Â£5/month though so a bit more costly than instagram).

>Gave up on this video as although it wasn't an obvious sell, I didn't want to feel baited into thinking I should join this community (yet, anyway).
