# Notes

## 「〜ている」
The train analogy is about to fall down a bit here but not excessively so.
When we want to say that A is doing something *right now*, we use "-ing". The Japanese counterpart for this is 「〜ている」, and is conceptualised as another engine in the sentence, like particles are extra carriages.

The main engine is still the thing that ends in 「う」, but the other engine is the part that could have been an engine, the verb that gets converted into 「て」form.

The main engine is 「いる」, and the white engine is 「食べて」, because 食べる can be an engine on its own.

The core sentence is 犬がいる, and it is eating as it exists.
