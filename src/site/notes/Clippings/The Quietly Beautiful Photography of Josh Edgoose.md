# Notes

Centred on the photos made by [[Josh Edgoose\|Josh Edgoose]].
Has a very soft style to the photos - almost pastel. Apparently quite 1950's <!--note: I'm not sure if colour photography was around in the 1950's?-->
"Suburbia" - this idea of a quiet, peaceful kind of living.

A question to think about when viewing a scene that might be commonplace to some - "What potential does this have?" - not how does it look now, but how could it look if things fell a certain way.

Processing as a part of digital photography is not something that should be looked down upon inherently - rather it depends on how intention (perhaps [[Books/Vision & Voice - David duChemin\|duChemin]] would say vision), are used to guide the processing, rather than merely putting an all-purpose filter on (for example).

Whether Josh's photographs are run through post-processing or taken on a specific film stock is immaterial, the photos themselves elicit a particular mood. For Alex, it's a sense that the images reflect his own childhood. These photographs don't stand out because of some amazing sense of composition - rather they elicit a feeling a safety, or comfort.
