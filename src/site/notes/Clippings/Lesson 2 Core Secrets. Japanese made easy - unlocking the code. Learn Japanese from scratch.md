# Notes
In the [[Clippings/Lesson 1 Japanese made easy What schools never teach. The core Japanese sentence -organic Japanese\|previous lesson]], visualised sentences as carriages being pulled by engines.
Here there are two new kinds of carriage.

## Zero carriage
In English, often use "it" to refer to something to avoid repetition when it is obvious.

<center>The ball rolled down the hill. It hit a rock. It burst.</center>

Whilst grammatically incorrect, it would still be intelligible as:

<center> The ball rolled down the hill. Hit a rock. Burst.</center>

Japanese allows us to omit having to specify "it". This is the zero carriage.
The zero carriage can have a particle, like「が」, but the particle is also "zeroed" out by the carriage.

<center>
（0が）ティムだ。
</center>

Without any context, by default the zero carriage refers to the speaker. But, just like "it", it can refer to anything.

## White carriages
Every sentence consists of a core - the engine and the main carriage.
But there are other carriages that can be added that modify the main carriage or the engine.
We'll call such carriages *white carriages* (the colour is irrelevant, they just distinguish them from normal ones).

## 「を」carriage linkage
Logical particles are all carriage linkages - they link carriages into the sentence.

「を」is such a linkage - when put after a noun, it forms a white carriage and specifies something that is having something done to it.

The sentence 「私がケーキを食べる」can be broken down as:
- 私が食べる: Core sentence
- ケーキを: White carriage (that modifies the engine)
