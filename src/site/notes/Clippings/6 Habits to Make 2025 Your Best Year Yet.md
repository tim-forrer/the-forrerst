# Notes

## Habit 1 - Quarterly Quests
Not sure how I feel about this name, but making it sound like an adventure is supposed to make it more fun.
Set around 3/4. Any more is too many.
Make the quests sort of like "mini-projects" with tangible goals.

## Habit 2 - Weekly Review
Spend ~20mins reviewing the previous week, and asking yourself the things that you want to focus on the following week.
Key prompt:
- What were my quarterly quests, and how are they going?
Define top 3 priorities for the week ahead.

## Habit 3 - The Morning Manifesto
Two min journalling prompt:
- What were my top three priorities for the week, and how are they going?
- What do I want to work on today?
He likes to phrase the second prompt as "What is today's adventure going to be?", again making it seem like a fun adventure.

## Habit 4 - Focus Logs
Make a simple record of the number of minutes spend on focussed work on a goal, to give you an awareness of your productivity.

## Habit 5 - Standing Order Social Events
Once a week, or every two weeks, have a social event that always happens without fail. Whoever can make it, makes it. Otherwise, no big deal.

## Habit 6 - Multimodality Multitasking
Doing multiple things at once, but not whilst focussing on specific work, but instead when doing things related to different areas ("multimodal").
Basically, if you are spending time doing something "low-attention", like shopping, or laundry, listen to audiobooks or something.
Might have included this to try and promote his app.
Personally I don't know how much benefit this brings, but I guess it's better than nothing.
