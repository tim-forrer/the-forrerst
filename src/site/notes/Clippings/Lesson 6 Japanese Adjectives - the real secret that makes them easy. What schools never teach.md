# Notes
In [[Clippings/Lesson 1 Japanese made easy What schools never teach. The core Japanese sentence -organic Japanese\|lesson 1]], the three classes of train engine were introduced:
- う-trains (verb)
- だ-trains (noun + copula)
- い-trains ("adjective")

All of these can be used like an adjective.

## 「う」adjectives
A verb, in any tense, can be used as an adjective that comes before a noun.

<center>赤い＋ペンが</center>

But as there is no engine at the end of the train, this sentence is incomplete.

<center>赤いペンが落ちた。</center>

Now there's an engine at the end (also a う), we have a complete sentence.

## 「い」adjectives
These were already classed as adjectives, so there's really not much to say here.

## 「だ」adjectives
Things become a little more complicated with 「だ」as there are two ways to turn them into adjectives, depending on the kind of noun.

### 「な」adjectives
The first kind of noun (which is commonly termed as a class of adjective) are those that replace「だ」with「な」when they become adjectives.

<center>嫌いな食べ物を買いたくない。</center>

### 「の」adjectives
The second kind is that which uses 「の」, and indicates possession, either belonging to someone/thing, or else thought of as belonging to a class of things.

<center>私のカバンが無くなった。</center>

My bag has gone missing.

<center>ウサギのオスカー。</center>

Oscar who belongs to the class of rabbits.
