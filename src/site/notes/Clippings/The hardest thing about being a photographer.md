# Notes
... is putting your work out there ([[Zettelkasten/On feeling inadequate\|would agree]]).

But James thinks of it like this. You shouldn't be afraid of the risk that someone out there won't like your work.
Because it's not a risk - it's guaranteed.

Every photo of significance has had observers who have not been impressed or moved by them. The same is true of any art form - think of how many people complain about number 1 hits.

>[!quote] If it's universally tolerated, it probably means it's quite vanilla.

He found it freeing to instead view ==sharing his photos as a way for those who would like them to actually find them==, rather than hope that everyone who sees them likes them.

Love the general style of images he took in Vietnam. The red is maybe a tad bold for me compared to the rest of the image, but maybe there should be a little more sensitivity when playing around with colours of national significance.
