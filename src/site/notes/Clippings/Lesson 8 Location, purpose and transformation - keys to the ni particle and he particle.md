# Notes

## Purpose of action
Take the sentence

<center>お店に卵を買いに行く。</center>

Note in [[Clippings/Lesson 8b Japanese particles explained. How they REALLY work\|lesson 8b]], we said that logical particles like に only attach to nouns.
This is why 買う→買い - ==changing to the い stem makes it into a noun==.

There are two targets in the above sentence, and they both act to modify 「行く」.
The core sentence is I go (the 私が has been zeroed out).
買いに行くmeans that the purpose of my going is to buy.
卵を買いに行くadds on that I am buying eggs.
お店に卵を買いに行くadds on the physical target of the action: For the purpose of buying eggs I go to the shop.
