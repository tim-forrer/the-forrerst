# Notes
Whilst it's common to classify words in Japanese as one of nouns, verbs, or adjectives, there is an alternative classification:
1. {体言|たいげん} - cannot be modified, other than through particles or copula.
2. {用言|ようげん} - can be modified through the かな they end with. They also form predicates on their own and hence do not need particles or the copula.

>[!question]
>The video says that 用言 *cannot* have particles or the copula added - but it's quite easy to think of counter examples. E.g. 美しいです。Something to be clarified maybe.

体言＋particle = "unit"
体言＋copula = 用言

「で」is restricted to sentence that modify 用言.

| Logical Particle | Meaning                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| に               | Where something goes to/where it stays when it is there |
| へ               | Directional particle                                    |
| で               | The boundary/limit within which something happens       | 

This boundary does not need to be a physical one (but usually is).

# Examples
==世界で==一番美味しいラーメン。
世界 is a 体言, so 世界＋で becomes a unit that defines the boundary within which the following 用言 is applied (一番美味しい).

>[!note]
>We could also say 「このラーメンは世界**で**一番美味しい。」but we *cannot* say 「このラーメンは世界**の**一番美味しい。」
>This is because in the later sentence, 「の」(and indeed all words) can only modify nouns that come *after* it, but no nouns appear after it, so there is nothing that can be modified.
>We can say 「世界の一番美味しいラーメン」because now the noun 「ラーメン」appears after 「の」.

==世界で==一番有名なアンドロイド。
Here, note that we need to use 「な」in order to turn 有名, a 体言, into a 用言 that can now be modified by 世界で.

==みんなで==行く。
行くis a 用言 so there is no issue with modifying it. We establish a "limit" or boundary that 行くtakes place.
