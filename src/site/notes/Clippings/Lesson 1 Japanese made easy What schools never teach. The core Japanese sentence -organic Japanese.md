# Notes
Every sentence essentially can be boiled down to:
- A does B.
- A is B.

Can think of B as a train engine, what makes the sentence work. A is the carriage, without it, there is nothing for B (the engine) to work on.

In both instances, A is linked to B via the particle 「が」: A が B.

田中が歩く。A does B.
りんごが青い。A is B.
田中が日本人だ。A is B.

Note that in the final example, we needed a use of 「だ」, it's not needed for 〜い adjectives because it is baked into it.

So sentences can end in three ways:
- 「う」- with a verb (A does B).
- 「い」- with an adjective (A is B).
- 「だ」- noun + だ (A is B).
