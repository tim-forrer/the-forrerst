# Notes
Here we get a flag and a new particle carriage to add to our train.

## 「は」flag
「は」can be better imagined as a flag in our train metaphor - rather than a logical particle. It simply is stuck on top of the train (the sentence) indicating what the topic is of the train is.

The confusion with が comes in in simple sentences like

<center>私はイギリス人だ。</center>

This is because the above sentence is making use of the [[Clippings/Lesson 2 Core Secrets. Japanese made easy - unlocking the code. Learn Japanese from scratch#Zero carriage\|zero carriage]]. The real sentence is:

<center>私は（0が）イギリス人だ。</center>

## 「に」carriage
The next carriage particle we'll introduce is 「に」which indicates the "ultimate target" of what is being done.

## Flags and zero carriages
The 「は」flag can often be used to zero carriages, not necessarily just 「が」ones.
Consider the following sentences:

<center>
私は（0が）ボールを田中に投げる。
</center>
<center>
ボールは私が（0を）田中に投げる。
</center>
<center>
田中は私がボールを（0に）投げる。
</center>

Logically, they *all mean the same thing* - because the logical particles are always attached to the same thing.

However - the zero carriage relies strongly on interpreted context.
*It is not obvious from context* that there is a zero carriage on に in the third sentence so it might be ambiguous. But it *can* carry that meaning.
