# Vision in Focus

>[!quote] Vision is like a visual opinion.

Given that 50% of the title is dedicated to the word, it makes sense to start by expressing exactly what "Vision" is. For David, he thinks that it's overloaded as a term, and that we associate with a concept that is grander than what it can be, and this grandness is what makes it seem elusive for photographers.

A child does not understand their vision to draw from it - it is an intuition that guides creativity. The aim is to recover this in some way, to allow your vision to guide your photography and editing process.

# Vision & Process

Writers don't write only when they have inspiration - they write to find it. The same is true for photographers.

The process of discovering your vision is achieved through creative pursuit. Any time a scene strikes you in some way as interesting, it's key to work out why that was the case - even if it felt that way for only an instant. Then the task is to work out how to take a photo that captures that.

Your vision and voice evolve over time, which make them somewhat elusive to capture. But the end goal should not be to capture them.

>[!quote] Finding this elusive vision is not a destination; it's a journey.

Starting this journey comes through realising that your vision is not some obscure mathematical theory. It's just you.

This is big-picture vision, but what about in individual images? How can we apply our vision to a single frame? This can be a much harder task, especially given the multitude of options available to us in making the photograph, both before and after pressing the shutter. So don't worry about the options - ask why it is you were drawn to the scene. No, don't ask, interrogate. Work hard to understand why you felt drawn in.

==A picture might be worth a thousand words, but what if it was only worth one - what would it be?==<!--note: Feels like a really important message to remember.-->

It's meaningless to aimlessly edit an image in the hope of making it "better" - unless you something to measure this against. This should be your vision.

# Vision & Style
We shouldn't look to the style of others' work to try and rescue our own lack of vision. Rather, we should understand how they can be adapted to better showcase our vision. A distinctive photographic style is valued because it is rare. But it is something that comes about of the course of expressing our vision - rather than trying to fake a style that doesn't really fit it.

# A Vision-Driven Workflow
A vision-driven workflow encompasses the entire lifecycle of an image: conception, capture, development, and output. This book is focussed on *development*.

The thread that binds these four steps together is vision. It begins with asking deeper questions than "How can I make this look better?".

## Intension
What is this image about? Is there a mood, thought, or emotion that it should carry?

## Aesthetics
What does that mood or emotion look like? What do I want people to look at - in very specific detail?

## Process
What digital tools are available to best align the image to my vision?
Answering this question comes first from identifying
